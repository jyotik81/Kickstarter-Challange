# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Project is to produce and visualize dataset to understand different Fundraising campaigns outcomes.  So that Louise can set up fundraising goal for his play. 
Basically , we have to present data to understand how different past fund raising campaigns raised their funds and what was the outcome. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this data analysis project is to study the outcomes of different fundraising campaigns , 
results, goals , launch dates etc. on basis of the reason and Source of fund raising. 

## Analysis and Challenges 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In this analysis project , I have to calculate the past fundraising campaign outcomes based on launch date especially Theater campaigns. 
Hence I have summarized data which was relevant to this project like - 
- calculation of year and month. 
- Filtering data on basis of outcomes. 
- Subcaterizing data according the its category.
- As Louise's has play Fever for fundraising campaigns , I did analysis of data based on Theater Category based on launch date. 
- So I used pivot tables, to visualize the outcomes of fundraising for Category / Subcategory Theater/ Play by month wise. 
- Also has presented same data in form of chart for better visulaization of outcome. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

While doing this analysis , I have to present data to understand the outcome of pledge and goals achieved. 
This data analysis is to find out , for fundraising through play how much were pledged initially by how many and how many achieved their goals. 
This data is also calculated percentage wise for better understanding the outcomes. 
Also I presented data in Line chart form to determine trend of outcomes.  
This analysis will help Louise to pledge fundraising and achieve the goal of fundraising successfully. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The challenges were more with consolidating data and understanding the requirement of the project. 
I understood what data needs to be filtered and which data is needed to be formulaized which functions to use. 
Once understood , i could complete the assignment happily. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 Campaigns are mostly successful during summer time. 
Theater Category is most successful than any other Category for launching the campaign. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
One positive thing in this analysis came to knew is that Category play has 0 cancelled. They are either played successfully or failed. 
Line chart is showing that less pledge is more successful than pledging for more. 
However there is break even for range in bet. 15000 to 19999 where the chances are 50-50 for success or failure. 
So if Louise is confident about his play , he can take change to pledge in range of 15000 to 19999. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This data set is based on all over the world which needs to be more categorized based on region wise.
Another limitation of this data set is it might not recent time span it is on basis of old date range. 
 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We can create table or chart to find out campaign outcomes in last 5 yrs , region wise, on basis of the quality of the play.
